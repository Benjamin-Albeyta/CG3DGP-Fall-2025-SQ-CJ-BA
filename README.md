## Genres

3D Platformer, adventure, action.

## Inspiration

### [Super Mario Galaxy]
Inspiration in terms of general game structure, level design, controls and movement. Being a level by level linear structure with different environments throughout. The general level design of a linear 3D platformer is largely where our inspiration from Mario Galaxy comes from; along with the variety of moves that Mario has while exploring a level and how those can lend themselves to more enjoyable gameplay and level design.

### [A Hat in Time]
More inspiration in terms of movement, general momentum, level design as well as having more creative objectives and concepts on a level per level basis. Inspiration in terms of what can be done with a similar base set of mechanics to what we have.

### [Animal Crossing]

Animal Crossing is a social simulation game with anthropomorphic villager characters. The player spends time collecting items, catching bugs and fish, and customizing their island. Its cute and dreamy, yet semi-realistic art style influences our design. Additionally, we will take inspiration from its functionalities to interact with many objects in the game.

### [Monument Valley]

Monument Valley is a puzzle and indie game by Ustwo Games. The player leads the princess Ida through mazes of optical illusions and impossible objects while manipulating the world around her to reach various platforms. We will take inspiration from their environmental art and puzzle level design, which matches our dream setting. We will also try to manipulate the geometry and perspective to unlock different user experiences.
